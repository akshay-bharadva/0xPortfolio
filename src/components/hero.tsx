            Heya! I&apos;m fullstack developer and life-long learner,from India, living in
            ON, Canada. I enjoy learning new technologies and collaborating with
            other developers to make products a reality. I also enjoy
            open-source, and despite having a full-time job, I devote time to
            exploring open-source projects and studying their tech stack and
            coding conventions.
          </p>
          <p className="font-space text-gray-800 leading-relaxed text-base"> {/* Adjusted text color and leading */}
            Fun but sad fact: I often misspelled the return keyword. i.e,{" "}
            <span className="text-indigo-700 font-bold bg-yellow-200 px-1 border border-black">&ldquo;reutrn&rdquo;</span>. let me
            know if you have any trick so that I can avoid this mistake.(P.S. thanks to linter for preventing me to broke pipeline of the deployment ðŸ˜…)
